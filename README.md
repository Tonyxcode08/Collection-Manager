Collection Manager v2

A basic utility for tracking a collection, in my case my collection of xbox 360 games
I built this to practise my skills in programming, specifically file handling and the tabulate module

## FEATURES
-View data in a table with formatting
-Highly customizable for different collections
-Saves changes back into the games.txt
-Edit data inside the program
## ADDED IN V2
-Print the table to a file
-Extra comments for maintainability

## NEXT STEPS
-Modularize my code
